Tech for Palestine is an umbrella group for the disparate groups in tech working towards Palestinian 
freedom. This is brand new and things are super fluid. 

# Goals

This is a place for the tech community to work together to help end the war on the people of Gaza, by 
contributing in any way we can to have a permanent ceasefire.

Our short-term goal is to normalize and enable tech folks to speak up for the people of Palestine.

# Organization

This is a very early stage project, and is for the moment being run by Paul Biggar, to bring together 
all the different projects, volunteers, founders, engineers, investors, and activists who reached out 
after his [I can't sleep](https://blog.paulbiggar.com/i-cant-sleep) blog post.

The founding team is engineers, founders, community organizers, and activists from the tech ecosystem.

We work in an invite-only discord, for obvious reasons.

# Secrecy

When contributing, consider whether you want to use your real account. While that would help normalize 
things, it might also cause attempted cancellation by the other team. We are happy to work with semi- or
fully-anonymous individuals.

# How to help

Contact: paul.biggar@gmail.com

We are a clearing house, that brings volunteers together, combined with a shared goal, and direction,
advice and guidance.

If you are working on something, get in touch and you can meet volunteers who are eager to help.

If you don't know what you want to work on, get in touch and tell us your job and skillset. We'll find
you people to work with.

We need engineers, designers, data scientists, marketers, community builders, and researchers.

We also need people with experience owning and running projects (eg experienced founders, CEOs,
PMs, etc).

We also need people with deep understanding of various parts of tech, and with relationships within them,
such as investors, founders, folks on the conference circuit, and open source maintainers.

# Projects

We do projects with the goal of normalizing Palestinian humanity within the tech community:
- help tech people speak up for Palestine, esp about the genocide in Gaza
- fight for a permanent ceasefire
- support Palestinians within tech (diaspora, and within Palestine)
- raise awareness of investors/companies who are part of the anti-Palestinian movement
- bring support and work with investors and companies who are part of the pro-Palestinian movement
- bring awareness to the humanity of the Palestinian people
- activism to bring awareness to Israeli genocide and how tech is complicit

# Code of conduct

Coming soon. Usual stuff. We have a zero tolerance policy for anti-semitism or advocacy of
violence: ambiguous statements should be explained or restated, unambiguous statements result 
in an immediate ban, regardless of role.
