Tech for Palestine is an umbrella group for the disparate groups in tech working
towards Palestinian freedom. This is brand new and things are super fluid.

# Goals

This is a place for the tech community to work together to help end the war on
the people of Gaza, by contributing in any way we can to have a permanent
ceasefire.

Our short-term goal is to normalize and enable tech folks to speak up for the
people of Palestine. Our main goal is to shift the Overton Window, and make it
easier to speak up for Palestinian humanity and freedom, while making it harder
to say the sort of genocidal statements about Palestine that are common among
tech investors and leaders.

# Organization

This is a very early stage project, and is for the moment being run by Paul
Biggar, to bring together all the different projects and people who reached out
after his [I can't sleep](https://blog.paulbiggar.com/i-cant-sleep) blog post.

The founding team is made up of dozens of founders, engineers, investors,
product, marketing, community organizers, and activists from the tech ecosystem.

The community is governed by a [Code of
conduct](https://github.com/techforpalestine/code-of-conduct).

We hang out [in our discord](https://techforpalestine.org/discord-invite).

# Privacy/security

When contributing, consider whether you want to use your real account. We are
happy to work with semi- or fully-anonymous individuals (that is, using clean
emails and accounts only when speaking with us) on GitHub or in our Discord.

# Projects

We do projects with the goal of normalizing Palestinian humanity within the 
tech community:

- help tech people speak up for Palestine, especially about the genocide in Gaza
- fight for a permanent ceasefire
- raise awareness of investors/companies who are part of the anti-Palestinian movement
- bring support and work with investors and companies who are part of the pro-Palestinian movement
- support Palestinians within tech (both the diaspora, and within Palestine)
- bring awareness to the humanity of the Palestinian people
- activism to bring awareness to Israeli genocide and how tech is complicit

We also try to help out other projects working on similar goals, including those
parts of the movement whose focus is outside of tech.

# How to help

We welcome volunteers and try to connect them with our projects and other
projects in the ecosystem.

As we are brand new, our process of connecting people is a little haphazard and
broken - we're working on it.

## Volunteering your talents

There are a few places in our discord where you can volunteer your talents. Each 
of these are categories (groups of channels) of our Discord, currently named:

### Official TFP projects

These are official projects that have joined the collective, and usually have
[GitHub repos](https://github.com/orgs/TechForPalestine/repositories). 

### Community Experiments

When one or more members of the community starts something, we will give them a 
channel to conduct the experiment, and maybe a GitHub repo. These may later become 
official projects, die from lack of interest, learn that it will not be successful, 
or may choose not to become an official project and move elsewhere.

### External Projects

Many people work in the broader ecosystem, and we suggest that those projects have 
a channel in our discord where they can recruit technical help, liase with the community,
etc. They will occasionally post their needs, or you can contact them there and see how 
you can help.

## Joining Tech For Palestine with a project

If you have an existing project and would like to become one of the collective, we're
recruiting. In particular, this is suitable for projects which help with our goal of
changing how the tech industry perceives Palestinian people. This is pretty broad, 
however, and if you can articulate a good thesis for how it fits, that's fine.

Official projects are run as official projects in the Discord, and get direct resources
(such as PM support), cloud hosting, as well as official URLs, branding, and marketing 
support. It is also good for people worried about their reputation or job - running it 
as a TFP project can help distance you and helps reduce the risk.

Note that we don't require you become part of TFP to benefit from the community. You can
ask for a liason channel in our Discord to help you stay in touch with our community, and
should feel free to recruit technical talent from our discord. We can help connect you to
people you need. We're also happy to market with you if it matches our goals (for example,
we're happy to tweet or retweet projects which match, do collaborations, etc).

To propose adding a project, post in our 
[project channel](https://discord.com/channels/1186702814341234740/1192871299509391512).

### Suggest/work on a new project

You do not need our permission to start a new project that fits in our goals --
we are a broad community and anything that fits under our goals is welcome as
long as it abides by our [Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/TechForPalestine/code-of-conduct).

Project proposals and ideas can be posted in our [project forum](https://discord.com/channels/1186702814341234740/1192871299509391512) in the discord. These can become Community Experiments if people wish, and can become Official TFP projects as well.

If you start one, we can add a channel in our discord and work with you to get
the resources you need (usually volunteers).
