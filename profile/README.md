Tech for Palestine is an umbrella group for the disparate groups in tech working
towards Palestinian freedom. This is brand new and things are super fluid.

# Goals

This is a place for the tech community to work together to help end the war on
the people of Gaza, by contributing in any way we can to have a permanent
ceasefire.

Our short-term goal is to normalize and enable tech folks to speak up for the
people of Palestine. Our main goal is to shift the Overton Window, and make it
easier to speak up for Palestinian humanity and freedom, while making it harder
to say the sort of genocidal statements about Palestine that are common among
tech investors and leaders.

# Organization

This is a very early stage project, and is for the moment being run by Paul
Biggar, to bring together all the different projects and people who reached out
after his [I can't sleep](https://blog.paulbiggar.com/i-cant-sleep) blog post.

The founding team is made up of dozens of founders, engineers, investors,
product, marketing, community organizers, and activists from the tech ecosystem.

The community is governed by a [Code of
conduct](https://github.com/techforpalestine/code-of-conduct).

We hang out [in our discord](https://techforpalestine.org/discord-invite).

# Privacy/security

When contributing, consider whether you want to use your real account. We are
happy to work with semi- or fully-anonymous individuals (that is, using clean
emails and accounts only when speaking with us) on GitHub or in our Discord.

# Projects

We do projects with the goal of normalizing Palestinian humanity within the tech community:

- help tech people speak up for Palestine, especially about the genocide in Gaza
- fight for a permanent ceasefire
- raise awareness of investors/companies who are part of the anti-Palestinian movement
- bring support and work with investors and companies who are part of the pro-Palestinian movement
- support Palestinians within tech (both the diaspora, and within Palestine)
- bring awareness to the humanity of the Palestinian people
- activism to bring awareness to Israeli genocide and how tech is complicit

We also try to help out other projects working on similar goals, including those
parts of the movement whose focus is outside of tech.

# How to help

We welcome volunteers and try to connect them with our projects and other
projects in the ecosystem.

As we are brand new, our process of connecting people is a little haphazard and
broken - we're working on it.

### Helping existing projects

- In our discord, look through the #projects and see if anything catches your fancy
- See if any of the [projects needing
  volunteers](https://github.com/orgs/TechForPalestine/discussions/categories/volunteers)
  suit you
- Look through our
  [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/TechForPalestine/repositories), read
  their READMEs and look through their issues.

### Volunteering your talents

- Join our [discord](https://techforpalestine.org/discord-invite) and introduce
  yourself in a #volunteer channel. We'll try and connect you to someone.
- Post to the [weekly volunteer thread in our
  forum](https://github.com/orgs/TechForPalestine/discussions/categories/volunteers)

### If you have an existing project

If you have an existing project, feel free to join our community in whatever
capacity is convenient. You can [tell people about
it](https://github.com/orgs/TechForPalestine/discussions/categories/volunteers)
and see if they'd like to work on it with you.

You can keep your project external if you wish, or move it under our umbrella
and/or github org if you prefer (eg if you are worried about privacy, for reach, or just
prefer that for whatever reason).

In our discord, you can have a channel for your project, either as the main
project channel, or just to liase with you from our community if you have a
different community around your project.

### Suggest/work on a new project

You do not need our permission to start a new project that fits in our goals --
we are a broad community and anything that fits under our goals is welcome as
long as it abides by our [Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/TechForPalestine/code-of-conduct).

In fact, we have a [list of projects](https://github.com/orgs/TechForPalestine/discussions/categories/ideas) we wish someone would start.

If you start one, we can add a channel in our discord and work with you to get
the resources you need (usually volunteers).

If you have ideas you'd like to get collaborators on, post them in the
[Ideas forum](https://github.com/orgs/TechForPalestine/discussions/categories/ideas)
forum and ask for volunteers in the
[Volunteers forum](https://github.com/orgs/TechForPalestine/discussions/categories/volunteers).
